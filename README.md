# 🏠 Welcome here

This is a side-project of mine.  
I started it in a learning purpose during an unemployment time, in order to learn new things about fullstack apps.  

So here it is. A recipe application, written in Express.js with a little bit of pug, PostgreSQL, Docker and redis.  
And as a willing-to-be Product Owner (between other roles), I take advantage of this to write user stories and manage the projet. 
I work on it now and then, with no pressure or deadline. This is firstly an experimentation that should stay for fun and enjoyable.

# 🔧 Build instructions

Quite simple though. Just run 

```
docker-compose up --build
```

That's it ! A website is then available on http://localhost:3000/
